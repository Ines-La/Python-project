Test Cases:
I created an admin user and a normal user to test the program u can create more but please WITH THE PROGRAM EXECUTION DON'T MODIFY THE FILES MANUALLY!
you can find users to test the program in "users.txt" file, the credentials are separated with "|" like "username|password" fill the form after clicking on signin button in the program.
(the file "users.txt" is editable with any of the text editors so u can just open it with notepad).
